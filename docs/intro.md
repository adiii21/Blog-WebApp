## What is Web 3 Anyway?

Web 3 is the third generation of internet services for websites and applications. Its aim is to create more connected websites. It is more focused on the usage of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. So, it is more or like the progressive evolution of the web. Also, computers will be able to understand like humans since it is based on a semantic web concept, thereby more reliable and accurate results are generated. With Web 3, information could be stored in multiple locations and hence it can be decentralized.
Web 3 is much more productive than Web 2 that mostly involves social media. Web 3 collects all the information you are looking for and provides you with your personal interest, saving hell a lot of time.
One of the key features of Web 3.0 is the rise of non-fungible tokens which allow digital assets such as art, music, and collectibles to be bought, sold, and traded in a secure and transparent manner. This opens up new opportunities for creators and collectors to participate in the digital economy in ways that were not possible before.

## What is NFT? Why is it trending?
Non-fungible item means something which is unique and cannot be exchanged for anything else. Fungibility is the Characteristic of a good or commodity where each unit is interchangeable and indistinguishable from another.  Assets like diamonds, land, or baseball cards are not fungible because each unit has unique qualities that add or subtract value. For instance, because individual diamonds have different cuts, colours, sizes, and grades, they are not interchangeable, so they cannot be referred to as fungible goods.
NFT is unique combination of the contract address and the token ID that make the NFT unique. The smart contract will never mint another NFT with that particular token ID. If someone just copy pastes the code in the smart contract and uploads their own smart contract to the blockchain, the address it has on the blockchain won’t be the same as the address of the smart contract the code was copied from, so you’ll never have exactly the same combination of contract address and token ID. This is trending because they offer a unique way to store transfer and own digital assets with continued grown of digital economy .So that’s makes it unique and trending in today’s generation.
Now let me walk you through with our project
Cryptobox – The NFT MARKETPLACE 
So here I am going to explain our project cryptobox, basically this is the NFT market place a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. 
Here we are providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing NFTs. Enabling the efficient and scalable management of large numbers of NFTs and related transactions. We are building a Web Application to mint to do minting and selling of NFT’s and also building a crypto token.
## What is Crypto Token and Wallet?
So Crypto token are valuable digital assets that can be traded or exchanged on blockchain networks. NFT dashboards use these tokens to store and transfer ownership of unique digital assets called non-fungible tokens.
In the world of crypto, a wallet is a crucial tool for managing digital assets. In our NFT dashboards, the wallet is seamlessly integrated, providing users with a convenient way to store and manage their NFTs and related transactions. With the wallet, users can easily send and receive NFTs, view their balance and transaction history. Having a wallet in an NFT dashboard simplifies the process of managing NFTs, making it accessible and user-friendly.

We made our own Wallet for the transaction related to NFT, which is known as TOKA and its very easy to use and user friendly. 

## What we do on cryptobox?

There are three major functions of cryptobox:
1. Discover Page
2. MY NFT
3. Minting 

Discovering NFTs just got easier with our new NFT Dashboard. On our Discover page, you'll find a list of all the NFTs that have been minted, complete with a buy button and price tag. Here, you can explore different NFTs and make purchases with just a click. When you buy an NFT, the transaction will be processed through the TOKA wallet. Make sure you have enough balance in your wallet, or you'll receive an error message. With our NFT Dashboard, finding and buying the perfect NFT has never been simpler.

“My NFTs” is the second section of our NFT dashboard. If you have purchased any NFTs in the past, they will be displayed in this section. This page serves as your personal NFT gallery where you can see all of your collected NFTs. If you decide to sell one of your NFTs, simply enter the desired selling price and it will be listed in the "Discover" page for others to purchase. Keep your NFT collection organized and accessible with this convenient feature.
The third page on our NFT dashboard is the Minting form, where users can create their own NFTs by filling out a simple form. To mint an NFT, users must first upload their NFT from their local device, and then choose a name for their new NFT. After submitting the form, the NFT minting process is complete and the new NFT will be added to the user's collection in the "My NFTs" section. With this feature, users can easily create and manage their own unique NFTs on the platform.
Now you completely visited our WebApp , let’s see how we build this.
How we build this project?
The development of the frontend for our NFT dashboard began with the creation of the user interface. We utilized the free and user-friendly design tool Figma to explore various existing marketplaces and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Through this research, we were able to create a simple and streamlined UI that offers users a smooth experience when minting and buying NFTs.
Next, we moved onto the development of the client side using ReactJS and JavaScript, which includes the NFT dashboard components such as buttons, menus, and forms. On the backend, we used NodeJS and the Motoko language to manage and process the data and functionalities of the NFT dashboard and wallet transactions.
The combination of the client and server-side results in a seamless and integrated user experience for our NFT platform.

## Project Planning and timeline
To ensure the success of this project it is necessary to have a clear plan and the timeline in place. As me and my teammates resides in the same hostel it gives us plenty to time to work together on this project.
We give maximum of our free time irrespective of the classes and assignments into this project and completed this whole project by 3 months. 
With our objective in the mind, we created a detailed project plan this include timeline and complete breakdown of the task which had to done in the respective time. This helps us to stay organised and on track throughout the project.
Project Reference and Ideas:
The project requires careful planning and executing the plan. First, its important to study the existing NFT marketplace which were already available out there in web some of major websites used for the reference are:
1.	WazirX
2.	Opensea , etc
This can include factor such as the types of NFTs offered, the user experience and the various payment options. This reference help us to stay informed in this wider blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. 

## What is the future of this project?
The future of this cryptobox is looking extremely promising with the exponential growth of NFT in recent years. Our project comes with the integrated wallet which makes our marketplace different from others, this is the big difference. The user no longer have to navigate between multiple platforms to manage their transactions, they can view their NFT balance and transaction history, manage their private keys in the same platform. This gives the smooth experience for the user and that’s make our NFT marketplace continues to grow.

In conclusion, the future of cryptobox looks bright and is expected to continue growing and expanding in the years to come. With its unique value proposition and the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, this NFT marketplace is poised to become a major player in the world of digital assets and creative works. Whether you're an artist, collector, or just someone who appreciates the unique value that NFTs bring to the table, it's clear that the future of the NFT marketplace is one worth paying attention to.

## Conclusion
The future of NFT in bright and it depends greatly on proper planning and execution of the plan. The opportunity to be a part of this growing industry is exciting and interesting to explore more and deep. We are thinking to add more additional features in this WebApp to be a long-term part of this industry. We think that cryptobox has a potential to be a major player in the world of digital assets and creative works. Hope this helps you in the journey of the blockchain.
